/* (About Myself) August 22 2022 */

/* Hello Everyone, My name is Ryan Deleon. I am currently earning my degree in BAS Computer Technology and Software Development. In my free time
I like to create music and cinematic music sound design since I get very nostalgic and a huge motivation from it. Lastly, I have a cat named Bella that I love dearly and she only eats whenever I eat. I have everyone have enjoyed my introduction and hope you enjoy this class as much as I will!

Sincerely, Ryan DeLeon. */
